# Scrap-Dragon
Trial Test (Scrap a website, translate, and upload into a webserver).

HTTrack was the choice for scrap a website. It had some difficulties in performing a proper scrap of the website. 
After a series of attempts, using different set-up options, HTTrack successfully completed its task. 
The setup was as follows:

At– Mirror Module - / Set options…:
    Browser ID / Browser Identity: we use “HyperBrowser(Cray; I;Organic OS 9.7.42.beta27” option. This very important, neither option could complete his task.
At Scan Rules:
    Include link(s) / Criterion: ALL LINKS
At Limits:
	  Maximum mirroring depth: 2
	  Maximum external depth: 2
    
The result was a folder in my local D:, with the html files and the backup documents.
